# job_seeks_intern

* The code uses python as a primary language to get all the data from the coursera career page using the API call and requests library of python.

* The text of the response has been parsed as the response had an error being converted to json format which was my first intuition going in to the problem.

* The output at the end is printed out in the desired format. For now, I have limited the output to [Job_Title, Job_Overview, Basic_Qualifications]. We can obviously add more if we desire to.

* No requests.txt file is needed as all the libraries used in the code are in-buils ones.

I hope you like and are able to understand the code without any difficulty.Please let me know if there are any other changes that need to be done :).
